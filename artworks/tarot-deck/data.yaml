description: "an ongoing collaborative exploration of ancient divination through contemporary lens. each card reinterprets classical tarot archetypes using modern symbolism, creating a bridge between mystical tradition and digital age spirituality"
process: "initial sketches developed into digital compositions, then transferred to linoleum blocks for hand-carved relief printing on textured paper. each card maintains the sacred geometry of traditional tarot while incorporating cybernetic and technological elements"
